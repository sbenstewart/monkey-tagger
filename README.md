A location tagging social platform for the people, by the people and of the people.

## Prerequisites

Nothing. Literrally nothing. Yes. You've read this right.

## Using monkey-tagger

The above serverless application is being hosted using the platform provided by Netlify.

* For accessing the platform as a user, use [this link](https://monkey-tagger.netlify.com/).
* For accessing the platform as an administrator, use [this link](https://monkey-tagger.netlify.com/manager).
* And. Don't let the name administrator stop you from using it.
* This platform is crowdbased and totally social. Which means all people can act as administrators.

## Moral constraints 

All the required tags of the monkey-tagger can be used as per the wish of the user. 

The posted tags can mean some intended meaning for the subset of users of the community, but those tags should not hurt other people online.

Considering the safety of other users online, care must be taken by all users to avoid any such untoward incidents.

## Run locally

For this, you will have to do the following steps.

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Change to the repo directory.
* Download the `Web Server for Chrome` web app from [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb).
* Lauch the same application. This can be done by searching for the same using [this link](chrome://extensions/).
* Change the hosting folder to the `/docs` subfolder of this repo.
* Access the Web Server URL as provided by the `Web Server for Chrome`.
* The links will be as follows.
    1. Basic user [rootURL](http://127.0.0.1:8887)
    2. Administrator [rootURL/manager](http://127.0.0.1:8887/manager)
* It is also fine that any other method to run the localhost server can be used.

## How was monkey-tagger developed

This project was put together in a single night by [me](http://sbenstewart.in/) and [one very cool junior](https://github.com/K-Gokul) for some symposium event of some department in some college that I could have happened to have studied (if that was called so) for four years. 

But. I'd also like to add in here those who planned this out, with me and contributed for all but the coding phase.
